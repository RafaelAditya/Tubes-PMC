# Securing UAV Communication with TinyJAMBU Cryptography: A Robust Approach to Counter Cybersecurity Threats
Securing UAV Communication with TinyJAMBU Cryptography
This project aims to develop a robust approach to secure UAV communication using the TinyJAMBU cryptography algorithm. As UAVs heavily rely on wireless communication networks to operate, they are vulnerable to various cyber attacks that compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of communication. Therefore, cryptography is a promising solution to address these challenges.

# Approach
Our approach is to integrate TinyJAMBU into UAV communication networks to provide high-level security. The approach includes encryption and decryption procedures, key management, and authentication. The TinyJAMBU algorithm is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for implementation on resource-constrained devices such as UAVs.

# Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

To identify the security challenges faced by UAV communication networks.
To explore the state-of-the-art solutions to address these challenges.
To introduce the TinyJAMBU algorithm and its key features.
To propose a robust approach to secure UAV communication using TinyJAMBU cryptography.
To evaluate the performance of our approach through simulations and experiments.
To compare our approach with other encryption algorithms commonly used in UAV communication.

# Usage
To use our approach, you can import the necessary files and call the relevant functions in your UAV communication system. You can also use the tests.py file to simulate and evaluate the performance of the approach.
